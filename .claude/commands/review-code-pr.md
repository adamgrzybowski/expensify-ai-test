Put one inline comment in 195 line of file src/components/MoneyRequestReportView/MoneyRequestReportTransactionList.tsx. The comment should be "IT WORKED!"

First try to use mcp tool to add comment. If this doesn't work use gh pr review command.

If something requires approval, explain it to me how to give approval
